When you search in Google, it tells you at the start how many results you have & what page you are on in the results. The Results Count plugin gives the same capabilities to Wordpress.

== Description ==

Results-Count is a very simple plugin that does exactly what it says on the tin & will count the number of posts that result from operations in Wordpress such as a search, viewing a category, or viewing a monthly archive etc. 
The purpose of the plugin is to allow you to insert text at the top of your archive & search results pages saying something like: results: 1-10 of 43. It serves the dual purpose of showing the number of results, as well as showing what page you are currently on within those results.

For an example of the plugin in use, look at the top of any of the archive or category pages at:

== Installation ==
1. Upload `results-count.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php wp_searchheader()?>` in your templates, where you want the text generated by the Results Count plugin to occur.

If you want to ensure that the plugin is installed first to stop errors with the template when it is disabled, then instead use the code:

`<?php if (function_exists('wp_searchheader')) : ?>`
`<?php wp_searchheader()?>`
`<?php endif; ?>`

Which will then automatically check for the plugin before trying to execute it.
